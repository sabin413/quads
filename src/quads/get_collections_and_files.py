    """
    For given model and date, finds a list of files in each collections using only the collection name token embedded in filenames.
      - Reads the address of the data directory from an YAML file, also gets a list of 'COLLECTIONS'.
      - For each collection listed in the YAML, finds files whose names contain the
        collection token (substring match) within that directory tree.
      - Keeps only files with .nc or .nc4 extensions.
      - Returns a list of all files, a (collection: files_list) dictionary,
        and the list of excluded variables EXCLUDED_VARS.
      - See a sample yaml file (/home/sadhika8/JupyterLinks/nobackup/quads/conf/dataserver.yaml) 

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : str
        which model? (e.g., "GEOSFP").
    date : datetime
        date for which you are processing files
    data_yaml_file : str | Path
        Path to the YAML config.

    Returns
    -------
    files : list[str]
         list of all matching file paths.
    collection_map : Dict[str, list[str]]
        Mapping of collection -> list of matching file paths.
    excluded : list[str]
        Variables to exclude from the YAML (EXCLUDED_VARS).

## NOTE:1.  The file names for each collection is done simply matching the collection name embedded inside the file names. More robust matching can be done
# by putting more matching criterion, such as matching file patterns using the "FILES" entry (currently not used) from the .YAML
# NOTE:2. Only looks for .nc and .nc4 files, excluding any other formats
# NOTE:3. Note how the code can handle  both daily and monthly sub directories - date.strftime() converts a datatime object (date here) into a formatted string 
# datetime, Path(datetime) -> converts datetime into a path object, Path(string).glob() -- gives all file and folder list at that address, not recursive
# for a given date: YYYY-MM-DD, for merra2 and geosit, the code goes it the right monthly subdir ignoring the date. It is intentional as we only need monthly aggregates later while
# building the database. But the files need to "ungrouped" while compuing daily results for the users.

# GEOSIT and MERRA2 seem confusing in terms of the collections they have
# MERRA2: has files stored in monthly subdirs. In addition to daily files they have .avg, .montly, and .diurnal and my script (pattern) excludes them. Might need to talk to the scientists again.
# GEOSIT: has only aggregated files, e.g. see here: /discover/nobackup/projects/gmao/geos-it/dao_ops/intermediate/d5294_geosit_jan18/diag/Y2024/M03, it only has .avg, .monthly, and .diurnal files. 
# Alexey told me to ignore them -- so, now I am moving forward with my code development with only the three models GEOSFP (daily subdirs), GEOSCF (daily subdirs), and MERRA2 (monthly subdirs).
